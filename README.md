# Monster-Recognition
Tensorflow model used to recognize pocket sized monsters

  The following contains a google colab file that creates a keras model to recognize images of pockcet monsters.
  The current model in the following commit has low accuracy and was made using only jpg images from the first 3 examples, in alphabetic order.

  Further improvements will start with altering the training parameters and including more examples.

  The dataset used was found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikoajkolman/pokemon-images-first-generation17000-files?resource=download

  To work with the current code, the images must be stored in the content directory of google colab, ie content/pokemon/pikahcu would contain all the pikachu images.
